# Grid-connected-VSM-based-on-Virtual-inertia-control
This repository implements a grid-connected VSM that enables inverters to emulate synchronous generator behavior using virtual inertia and damping. The model includes dq-frame control, droop control, and LCL-filter-based voltage–current regulation, simulated in MATLAB/Simulink.
